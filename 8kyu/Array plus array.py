# Description

# I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

# P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.


# My Solution
def array_plus_array(arr1, arr2):
    return sum(arr1) + sum(arr2)


# Uncomment to run and check test cases
# print(array_plus_array([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]))  # Output: 21
# print(array_plus_array([-1, -2, -3], [-4, -5, -6]))   # Output: -21
