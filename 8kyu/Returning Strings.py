# Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

# [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]


# My Solution
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name} how are you doing today?"


# Uncomment to run and check test cases
# print(greet("John"))  # Output: "Hello, John how are you doing today?"
