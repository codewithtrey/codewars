# Description

# Bob needs a fast way to calculate the volume of a cuboid with three values: the length, width and height of the cuboid. Write a function to help Bob with this calculation.


# My Solution
def get_volume_of_cuboid(length, width, height):
    return length * width * height


# Uncomment to run and check test cases
# print(get_volume_of_cuboid(1,2,2))  # Output: 4
# print(get_volume_of_cuboid(6.3, 2, 5))  # Output: 63
